What is a Data Product?
========================================================
*  A data product is any App, or software, or presentation, or reproducible report based on data or something that helps people
analyze a common form of data. 

*  In this class, we'll talk about all different sorts of data product, such as how to create a Slidify lecture, how to use our studio presenter, how to create a Shiny App (Shiny creates little web Apps using R), how to use R charts and create interactive graphics, and many other tools for creating impressive data products quickly.


Why are data products important
========================================================
So imagine your boss calls you to a
meeting, and wants to talk to you about three
problems. First all the software that your group has developed is being widely used throughout
the company, though many people are complaining about how hard
it is to install, and using functions and
what not. Well your friend Roger might actually
offer to say, well why don't we just create in our
package. Which will make installation a lot easier. Furthermore, imagine he mentions, your
boss mentions that there is a presentation that you have to give once
a month. And you want the numbers to be updated
automatically. well then maybe your friend, Jeff, would
say, oh well I can create a slidified
presentation, so that all we have to do is rerun the R code, and the presentation will be updated with
a new numbers.

========================================================
The third problem is that the boss wants a web App, for a prediction function that you've developed. And now you're nervous, because your web
skills are light, or non existent. And, or, like me, terribly rusty and
outdated. What's worse? Your friends Roger and Jeff are real nerd
bullies, and you know that they are going to make fun of
you about it. But after taking a walk, and clearing your
head, and talking with a friend, you realize that our's
under constant rapid development.

And new tools developed by our studio, and intrepid developers like Ramneth, are making it easier than
ever to make. Dynamic and interactive content in art. So let's get to work making that shiny
App. And when you're done, you can show it to Roger and Jeff, and they'll be very
jealous. And you can make fun of them for a change.
